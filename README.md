## Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! I am Daniel Parhizgar. Here you can find information about the projects I've worked on.

## Super boat land

"Super boat land" is a game that I created together with some friends for our own custom game jam. The theme was "Islands" and the game was made in 4 days. It is a little bit messy because it contains many different concepts but we did learn a lot for future game jams.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mariostarr/Mariostarr.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
